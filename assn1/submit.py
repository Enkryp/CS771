		# Write all code to perform your method updates here within the infinite while loop

		# in this part of the code instead of X and y -- please take care
		
		# Please note that once timeout is reached, the code will simply return W, B
		# Thus, if you wish to return the average model (as is sometimes done for GD),
		# you need to make sure that W, B store the averages at all times
		# One way to do so is to define a "running" variable w_run, b_run
		# Make all GD updates to W_run e.g. W_run = W_run - step * delW (similarly for B_run)
		# Then use a running average formula to update W (similarly for B)
		# W = (W * (t-1) + W_run)/t
		# This way, W, B will always store the averages and can be returned at any time
		# In this scheme, W, B play the role of the "cumulative" variables in the course module optLib (see the cs771 library)
		# W_run, B_run on the other hand, play the role of the "theta" variable in the course module optLib (see the cs771 library)
